🍷 Wine Quality Prediction - A Data-Driven Approach to Smart Industry
This project uses machine learning to predict the quality of wine based on its physicochemical properties. It's designed to showcase how data science and AI can power smart industry solutions.

🚀 Live Demo
Check out the deployed web app:
🔗 Wine Quality Prediction App

📊 Problem Statement
The goal is to predict wine quality scores using various chemical properties of the wine, such as acidity, alcohol content, sulphates, etc. This can assist wineries and quality inspectors in automating quality assessment processes.

🔍 Features
Interactive Streamlit web app for wine quality prediction
User-friendly input interface for testing different wine profiles
Real-time prediction using a trained machine learning model
Visualization of dataset insights (can be added in future updates)
🧪 Tech Stack
Frontend: Streamlit
Backend / ML: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
Deployment: Streamlit Cloud
🛠️ How it Works
Data Preprocessing – Cleansing and preparing data for training
Model Training – Using algorithms like Random Forest and others to fit the model
Prediction – Predicting wine quality score (typically 0–10 scale)
Deployment – Streamlit app hosted for public access
